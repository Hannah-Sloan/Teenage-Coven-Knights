## What Is This?

This project is a TTRPG presented not through pdf, but **html**. I write the game system in markdown and then convert the markdown to HTML. You can check it out the at the link above, or browse the raw files here on github.

I'll use the github side of the project to document the development and my html design goals. I'm hoping to find a way to showcase my game design philosophy within the TTRPG somewhere, rather than here. 

## Style Constraints

I am brand new to HTML and CSS, so I have a number of constraints placed on the project so that it 1) does not get out of hand for my skill and 2) Has a cohesive style in its simplicity.

I am interested in making a truly HTML presented SRD, but this is not that project. My first constraint is that the game **only contains things I can do in markdown**. HTML is much more powerful than markdown, but this way I can potentially still create a PDF version as well.

### Accessibility

The rest are accessibility constraints in a hope that having a web version of an rpg could make it *more* accessible, despite the additional requirement for technology. If you have *any* accessibility concerns feel free to *create an issue* on Github and I will attempt to address it!

Documents should be **readable on all devices, resolutions, and text sizes.**

Following WCAG 2.1 as much as possible, ensuring easy readability and supporting screen readers.

<u>A few examples:</u>

-  Sections have headings that identify them: A correct **reading sequence can be programmatically determined**.
- Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information.
- The visual presentation of text and images of **text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1**.
- Text can be resized without assistive technology **up to 200 percent** without loss of content or functionality.
- Text is not justified.
- Line spacing is at least **space-and-a-half within paragraphs**, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
- Web pages have **titles** that describe topic or purpose.
- The purpose of each link can be determined from the **link text alone**.
